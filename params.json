Wherever the source. Whatever the format. \r\n\r\nUse the datap API to load your data into your R session.\r\n\r\nShare your datap contexts, add them to your source code repository, or keep various versions for development and production.\r\n\r\n## datap in 30 seconds\r\n\r\nWithin your datap context (i.e. the datap yaml file), you can\r\n\r\n1. define data processing **pipes**:\r\n    1. Where is your data coming from? (internet, file, db, memory, etc.)\r\n    2. How should your data be pre-processed? (cleaning, plausibility checking, missing value handling, etc.)\r\n2. define **taps** by\r\n    1. giving short id's to your datasets\r\n    2. organise your datasets into hierarchies\r\n\r\nOnce you defined your datap context, you can call your taps from R\r\n    1. by accessing a single, consistent API\r\n    4. to load your data into an R session\r\n\r\n",
