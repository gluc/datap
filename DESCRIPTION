Title: Manage Financial Timeseries
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Christoph Glur
Maintainer: Christoph Glur <christoph.glur@ipub.com>
Description: Manage financial timeseries from various sources such as
  Bloomberg, Quandl, and your proprietary price store. Define meta
  data for timeseries, specifying the source and possible transformations.
  This allows you, for example, to define a custom index as a 50/50
  combination of two stocks adjusted close prices, and to download, calculate,
  and load it into R memory with a single command.
  This is useful for custom indices, price proxies, futures stitches, and more.
